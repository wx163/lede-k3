License

This software is released under the MIT license. See COPYING for details.

Features
========
 - very lightweight (84KB of private memory per instance)
 - fixes broken CR/LF in headers
 - handles environment in a sane way (CGI scripts get HTTP-related env. vars from FastCGI parameters and inherit all the others from ``fcgiwrap``'s environment)
 - no configuration, so you can run several sites off the same ``fcgiwrap`` pool
 - passes CGI stderr output to ``fcgiwrap``'s stderr or FastCGI stderr stream

Installation
============

requirements
------------
``Makefile`` and ``configure`` script is generated by GNU *autotools*. Therefore you need the latter.

``pkg-config`` is needed, else you may get AC_DEFINE errors.

``fcgiwrap`` links to *dev-libs/fcgi* which can be obtained from http://www.fastcgi.com/ .

``fcgiwrap`` also uses (but not requires) ``systemd`` for socket activation.

procedure
---------
To install::

    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make
    make install

*fcgiwrap* will be copied to ``/usr/local/sbin/fcgiwrap`` if you did not set
``--prefix`` for configure or ``DESTDIR`` for the makefile.

usage
-----
Most probably you will want ``fcgiwrap`` be launched by `www-servers/spawn-fcgi <http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/spawn-fcgi>`_. Or you could use the author's Perl launcher - see the homepage for that.

There are two modes of ``fcgiwrap`` operation:
 - when *SCRIPT_FILENAME* is set, its value is treated as the script name and executed directly.
 - otherwise, *DOCUMENT_ROOT* and *SCRIPT_NAME* are concatenated and split back again into the script name and *PATH_INFO*. For example, given a *DOCUMENT_ROOT* of ``/www/cgi`` and *SCRIPT_NAME* of ``/subdir/example.cgi/foobar``, ``fcgiwrap`` will execute ``/www/cgi/subdir/example.cgi`` with *PATH_INFO* of ``/foobar`` (assuming ``example.cgi`` exists and is executable).
